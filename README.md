# AutoSwap
Simple unobtrusive addon that will automatically switch gearset as you change zones.

In profiles set each zone with its desired gearset name.
Maw = Raids, korthia & the maw itself  ( domination gear set )
Dungeons = Mythics and other dungeons
World = Everywhere else.

Your gearsets must be defined in the character screen and name in profile must
match EXACTLY to what the gearset name is.

If you don't want to swap for a particular zone then leave that zone blank.
